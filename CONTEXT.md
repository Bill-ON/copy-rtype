## Context of South Invaders

The goal of this project is to show the culmination of 3 years of game-development and networking learned through our studies at [EPITECH](https://www.epitech.eu/).
We have to create a multi-player online game based off the 90's hit : [R-Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type)
In summary it's a [shoot'em up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-Type) with an auto-scroller where the goal is to defeat hordes of aliens.
The end point of this project is to teach us, students and growing developers, how important proper documentation is for a to-be-released video-game and more importantly how an [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) works.
